This blog is intended to serve as a creative space for me to post articles on various topics that I find interesting at the moment. I’m a person that values **physical activity**, currently practicing muay thai to push my body to its limits while learning about self defense.
I’m a **software engineer** that just recently graduated and intend to keep learning about my field while implementing and posting about what i learn in this website. 
**Meditation** is also something I’ve used to stay focused and on top of things, since it helps me get back on track and be mindful about what I’m doing. Last but not least, I’m a person that loves to read and have always wanted to get into **creative** practices like painting, making music, learning the piano, and as of late, writing essays. So if any of this is interesting to you, I invite you to stay on top of things with me and follow me on my journey to constant **self-improvement** and becoming the best version of myself everyday.
